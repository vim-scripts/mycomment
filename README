# Mycomment

_A stupid comment plugin made for people can't remember so many mappings:)_

You only need to remember one mapping for comment:  `<leader>c`

## API

### [count]\<leader\>cc

Toggle comment of `count`(default current line) lines.

### \<leader\>cip

Toggle comment of a block. Yes, it's a motion mapping, `ip` could be any motion object.

### V\*\*\*\<leader\>c

Select a block and toggle comment

### g:mycomment_indent

The `regex` of the comment `indent`.

```
let g:mycomment_indent = '^*'   " Comment will be at the beginning of string
let g:mycomment_indent = '^\s*' " Default regex, comment after whitespace
```

## More productive

You can use `.` to repeat your last comment command, no need [vim-repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).

If you have [emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim), the plugin would use emmet comment function for comment toggle of tags in html/xml/xhtml files
